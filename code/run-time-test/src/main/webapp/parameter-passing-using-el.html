    <h1>Parameter Passing using the EL</h1>

<p>There is a prototype implementation of this concept at <a
href="https://javaserverfaces-spec-public.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=129">jsf-api
issue 129</a>.  Here's how it works.</p>

<p>It hacks UIComponentBase.encodeAll() to look in the request scope for
a value under the key "javax.faces.component".  If found, this value is
saved aside.  It then places "this" into the request scope under the key
javax.faces.component.  It then does the rest of encodeAll().  Just
before returning, it replaces the saved aside value, if any, otherwise
it puts null in the request scope under key "javax.faces.component".</p>

<p>The other part of this is to add "thisComponent" as an implicit
object to the ImplicitObjectELResolver.  The behavior of thisComponent
is simply to look in request scope for "javax.faces.component" and
return the result, if found.</p>

<p>These two simple tricks enable one to use f:setAttribute as a means
to pass parameters to subviews.  For example, in the outer page, one
could say:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;f:subview&gt;
  &lt;f:attribute name="gigName" value="#{some.expression}" /&gt;
  &lt;f:attribute name="gigVenue" value="#{some.other.expression}" /&gt;
  &lt;c:import page="whatever.jsp" /&gt;
&lt;/f:subview&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in whatever.jsp:</p>
<pre><code>
I have a gig called 
&lt;h:outputText value="#{thisComponent.parent.attributes.gigName}"&gt; at 
&lt;h:outputText value="#{thisComponent.parent.attributes.gigVenue}"&gt;.
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, there is the problem of the attribute set being persisted
as part of the saved state of the component.  This is probably not
desirable.</p>

<p>This approach is not practical if you can't modify the source for
UIComponent in the core jsf-api, which, of course, isn't really
practical.  Another approach is to limit the usefulness of this feature
by extending UINamingContainer and overriding the
javax.faces.NamingContainer component family.  The UINamingContainer
subclass would do the same request scope trick but under the key
"subview".  It would also override getAttributes() to be a simple map,
and not the special attribute/property transparency map provided by
UIComponentBase. </p>
