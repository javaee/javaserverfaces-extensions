    <h1>Project Dynamic Faces Samples</h1>

<p>This directory contains sample applications illustrating the usage of
Project Dynamic Faces.</p>

<h2>How to build the samples</h2>

<p>Building the samples is easy!  You need Apache Ant.  If you are
running this installation inside of Sun's Java System Application Server
you already have ant in the form of
<code>SUNWappserver/bin/asant</code>, where <code>SUNWappserver</code>
is the installation directory for the Application Server.  Otherwise,
you'll have to install ant from <a target="_new"
href="http://ant.apache.org/">The apache web site.</a></p>

<p>Once you have ant installed, examine the <a target="_"
href="build.properties"><code>build.properties</code></a> file in this
directory to ensure that the <code>javaee.jar</code> property points to
a valid <code>javaee.jar</code> file.  If necessary, modify the file
accordingly.</p>

<p>Finally, simply type "<code>ant</code>" at a command prompt in this
directory to build the samples.</p>

<h2>How to install the samples</h2>

<p>Once the samples have built successfully, for each sample you will
see a "<code>build</code>" directory.  In that directory will be a WAR
file, ready to deploy on your Application Server, and an exploded WAR
directory which can be deployed with the "deploydir" feature of the
Application Server.</p>

<h2>How to run the samples</h2>

<p>Just visit <code>http://server:port/context-path/</code> in a Firefox
web browser, where <code>server</code> is the host on which the
Application Server is installed, <code>port</code> is the port on which
the Application Server is running on that host, and
<code>context-path</code> is the part of the filename before the ".war"
in the file in the build directory for that sample.  Each sample has its
own README.html file in its sample directory.</p>
