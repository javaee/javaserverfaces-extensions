Vaadin requires two subclasses be created.

1.  @WebServlet(urlPatterns = {"/ui/*", "/VAADIN/*"})
    public static class MyServlet extends AbstractApplicationServlet

2. public class MainUI extends Application

In JavaJSF, I would like to avoid the necessity for 1.

To do this, I want to introduce an annotation you stick on your
Application class to declare it to the bootstrapping system.

To do that, I need to expose the com.sun.faces.spi for InjectionProvider.

InjectionProvider
InjectionProviderFactory
com.sun.faces.spi.AnnotationScanner
