        <p>This project hosts development of software that extends the
        capability of the JavaServer Faces specification, including
        revolutionary, world class, support for using AJAX and JSF.
        Software within this project is intended to run on any JSF
        compliant implementation, but in some cases the capabilities are
        enhanced when run with <a
        href="http://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/">Sun's
        implementation</a>.</p>

         <p>Similar to the <a
         href="http://struts.apache.org/struts-shale/">Struts Shale</a>
         project, JSF Extensions is delived as separate software parts,
         you can choose to use any combination of them, apart or
         together.  The software is groupd into three areas based on
         when in the software development lifecycle they should be
         used.</p>
         
        <subsection name="Run Time">

        <ul>

        <li><p>JSF and AJAX together: it just works.  JSF-Extensions
        run-time brings the power of AJAX to existing and future JSF
        developed applications.  Included in this software is an
        implementation of the Avatar concept demonstrated by Jacob
        Hookom Ed Burns, and Adam Winer in their <a
        href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2006/05/javaone_video_a_1.html">JavaOne
        2006 talk</a>.  JSF-Extensions avatar is also the best way to
        use <a href="http://ajax.dev.java.net/">jMaki</a>.</p></li>

        <li><p>Bring the "flash" concept from Ruby on Rails to your JSF
        applications!</p></li>

        </ul>

        <subsection name="Test Time">

        <p>Sun's JSF implementation uses Cactus, JUnit, and HTMLUnit for
        its automated testing.  We have extracted the testing framework
        from Sun's JSF implementation codebase and now offer it in this
        project.  This is a general purpose testing framework for JSF
        applications.  Sun's JSF implementation now depends on
        jsf-extensions for its testing framework.</p>

        </subsection>

        <subsection name="Design Time">

        <p>Sun's JSF implementation uses code generation to
        automatically create the JSP Tag Handlers and TLD files for the
        core jsf components.  We plan to extract this (or similar) code
        and offer it as part of this project.</p>
