    <h1>Sample Description</h1>

<p>This sample illustrates the behavior of the
<code>DynaFaces.fireAjaxTransaction</code> method, and in particular,
the behavior of the <code>execute</code> and <code>render</code>
options.  Complete reference materials for these options are available
<a href="https://jsf-extensions.dev.java.net">at the project
homepage</a>.</p>

<p>The <b>View</b> area is a view of PanelGrid and CommandButton
components. Initially, each of these components has a green border,
meaning that all these components have gone through the initial render
phase of the lifecycle. <p>Each of the <i>fireAjaxTransaction</i>
buttons causes a different <i>DynaFaces.fireAjaxTransaction</i> event to
occur, affecting one or more components in the view. The color of a
component may change color depending on what lifecycle phase the
component was processed.<p>The <b>Options</b> area shows the options
used with the <i>fireAjaxTransaction</i> command.  Press the
<b>Reset</b> button before firing a new command.</p>
