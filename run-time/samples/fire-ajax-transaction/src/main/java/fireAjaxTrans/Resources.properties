instructions=The <b>View</b> area is a view of PanelGrid and CommandButton components. Initially, each of these components has a green border, meaning that all these components have gone through the initial render phase of the lifecycle. <p>Each of the <i>fireAjaxTransaction</i> buttons causes a different <i>DynaFaces.fireAjaxTransaction</i> event to occur, affecting one or more components in the view. The color of a component may change color depending on what lifecycle phase the component was processed.<p>The <b>Options</b> area shows the options used with the <i>fireAjaxTransaction</i> command.  Press the <b>Reset</b> button before firing a new command.
